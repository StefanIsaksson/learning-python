# Learning about Python

## What
This repository contains snippets of Python code. 

## Why
1. Python is one of the most important languages in data science, and I am curious about that field.
2. Python seems to be a great language for automation of everyday tasks (i.e. updating files).
3. I want to learn more programming languages, and Python is new to me.
